I was very much looking forward to this project. After having thoroughly enjoyed coding my last application using vanilla Javascript, I was very excited to be able to build on that foundation using tools as powerful as React/Redux.

Truthfully I did not fully grasp the benefits of these libraries when they were first introduced. Though I had previously heard about them, I did not realize how much easier they could make writing JS applications. In the beginning, learning how to use React's Components did not really seem significant and its reliance on JSX to combine JS and HTML syntax honestly irked me slightly especially during the first few Flatiron lessons and labs, as it seemed to only bastardize two distinct and well-established languages to create a confusing hybrid. I could not quite understand the advantage of violating the separation of concerns previously established of having the HTML exist separately and away from the Javascript code.

In addition, the fact that React is built on declarative programming had little appeal to me personally. Although Ruby already exposed me to declarative programming in the earlier modules,  imperative programming still comes to me more naturally, given my previous experience with C++. The fact that my mind has a habit of walking through procedures and functions in a more logical and procedural manner to understand their flow means that I am drawn more towards wanting to see the steps of "how" code executes. 

However, with each passing code-along lab and lesson, the more exposure I received both to React and declarative programming in general, and the more apparent its benefits became. Though I still have a propensity towards imperative programming, the practicality of declarative programming is very obvious. No longer do I have to get into the nitty-gritty of all the steps necessary to get from point A to point B; I could just simply tell the code to do it and I can trust that it will be done.

React also allows for many types of applications to scale gracefully and easily, especially when combining React Component's versatility and reusability with the performance gains from the 'Virtual DOM' and the simplicity of handling both HTML and JS through JSX within the same Component. Of course, applications written in React have to be built following a certain structure in order to take full advantage of its strengths and plain Javascript still has its own set of advantages, demonstrated by its ubiquity even in modern applications. However, when it comes to building large applications with complex functionalities, using plain JS just takes longer to build, makes the application harder to maintain, and makes it more difficult to expand. In these cases, React makes for a great alternative.
