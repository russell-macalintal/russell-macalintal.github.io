I did it! I finally finished my last Portfolio Project and with it, my Flatiron Software Engineering Course Curriculum. It's been an incredible journey, albeit a long one (at least certainly longer than I had originally planned). These past 2 years have been one of the most challenging, but also one of the most rewarding, experiences of my life thus far. I have known a lot of people, including a few of my colleagues, who have worked full-time careers while going back to school to earn their Master's degree, MBA, or additional certifications. And I always knew that a high level of commitment was necessary to be able to achieve success on those endeavors, but I have underestimated just how much commitment it actually entails. Having now gone through the same situation, in the middle of the pandemic no less and with my structural engineering projects somehow getting busier compared to even during our busiest of seasons , I can honestly say that I completely appreciate the level of dedication that one must have to succeed in their dreams. It certainly is no easy feat and I'm proud to say that I got through it!

Truthfully there were times when I wished that I could have quit my job earlier and fully committed to the coding bootcamp; unfortunately, the timing could not have been worse for me and my family. Between raising my newborn and trying to find a new home outside of NYC, which was being ravaged by COVID-19 at the height of the pandemic, finding the correct moment to quit while minimizing the financial risks was near impossible. And as disappointed as I was that I was not able to pursue my dreams earlier, I had absolutely no qualms in prioritizing my family's well-being over my career. 

Luckily, now that we've had time settle down in our new home and with our son now safely attending daycare, I'm finally ready to completely invest my time and energy into my new future. I understand that although finishing the bootcamp is certainly a big step, it is but one step out of many. I know there is still a long road ahead and I still need to put forth a lot more effort into learning and practicing coding to get the proper experience and to walk down the proverbial path towards a better and brighter career. But I am very glad that I can close this chapter of my life and move onto the next. 

Today is actually the day that I have officially ended my career as a structural engineer and it is the day that I dive headfirst into the world of Software Engineering. Cheers!
